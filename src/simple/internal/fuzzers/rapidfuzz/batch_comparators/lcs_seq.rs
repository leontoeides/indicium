/// The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) measures the similarity between two
/// sequences by identifying the longest sequence of elements (characters,
/// numbers, etc.) that are common to both sequences. Importantly, the elements
/// in the common subsequence do not need to appear consecutively in the
/// original sequences.
///
/// Itâ€™s useful in applications where the order of elements is significant, but
/// their exact positions may vary. Common use cases involve:
///
/// * **Bioinformatics**: Commonly used in Bioinformatics for comparing genetic
///   sequences where identifying shared genes or regions, even if not
///   contiguous, is important.
///
/// * **Version Control Systems**: Tracking changes between different versions
///   of a document or codebase.
///
/// * **Plagiarism Detection**: Identifying similarities between texts even when
///   the wording is rearranged or some content is added or removed.
