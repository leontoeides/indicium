/// The Damerau-Levenshtein distance measures the minimum number of operations
/// required to transform one string into another, considering four types of
/// elementary edits: `insertions`, `deletions`, `substitutions`, and
/// `transpositions of adjacent characters`. A transposition involves swapping
/// two adjacent characters. It does respect triangle inequality, and is thus a
/// metric distance.
///
/// Itâ€™s often used in applications where transpositions are common. An example
/// for this would be typing errors involving adjacent characters.
