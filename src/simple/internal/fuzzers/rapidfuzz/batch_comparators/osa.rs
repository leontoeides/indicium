/// The Optimal String Alignment distance (OSA) measures the minimum number of
/// operations required to transform one string into another, considering four
/// types of elementary edits: `insertions`, `deletions`, `substitutions`, and
/// `transpositions`.
///
/// While both the `Damerau-Levenshtein` and OSA distance include
/// transpositions, they differ in the treatment of transpositions. OSA treats
/// any transposition as a single operation, regardless of whether the
/// transposed characters are adjacent or not. In contrast, the
/// Damerau-Levenshtein distance specifically allows transpositions of adjacent
/// characters.
///
/// The handling of transpositions in the OSA distance is simpler, which makes
/// it computationally less intensive.
